I'm kitzsh, also known as Sage.

I don't have much to show at the moment, but you  may know me from the following projects:
- [Flixel3D](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/flixel3d) 
    - A work-in-progress addon for the HaxeFlixel engine which adds 3D support
    - Has familiar, Flixel-like syntax
    - Designed for ease of use
- [Funkscop](https://gamejolt.com/games/funkscop/984595) 
    - A rhythmic retelling of Petscop, which I am one of the programmers for.
    - My main focuses are:
        - 3D environments (overworld and menus)
        - Rendering the game at 240p like a real PS1 console
        - Linux and Mac support
- [Tex-Packer-EX](https://kitzsh.github.io/tex-packer-ex) 
    - A fork of [Free texture packer](https://free-tex-packer.com) which adds new features and bug fixes, including:
        - The ability to repack/optimise existing spritesheets
        - Splitter for Sparrow/Starling spritesheets (the standard format for FNF)
        - Correctly ordered frames when exporting
